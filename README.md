# Experiencer: A Smartwatch-based Context-sensitive Experience Sampling Tool Designed for Researchers and Study Participants

[Experiencer](https://experiencer.eu/) is the outcome of an endeavor to create an ESM solution that benefits both researchers and study participants while leveraging the physiological sensors of commodity-level wearable devices.

## About
Experiencer software has been used in several research studies throughout its evolution. Such studies have been in line with the author's Ph.D. trajectory at the Eindhoven University of Technology (at the future everyday group of the industrial design department, also in collaboration with the human technology interaction group, industrial engineering department, and GGz Centraal). Experiencer is in the development phase and is being altered frequently. However, as we believe in **Openness, Availability, and Security**, we hereby open-source a recent and comparatively stable version of our Tizen smartwatch software, Experiencer, to advocate our blief and support the scientific community. The source code is available under the `src` directory.

## Case Studies
Examples of consumed configuration files to facilitate research execution in some of the research studies are accessible under the `examples/configuration` directory.
The unique identifiers and various string literals within the configurations that correspond to unpublished research are obfuscated to preserve the author's rights. Meanwhile, the configuration structure is intact, as consumed in the real study.
